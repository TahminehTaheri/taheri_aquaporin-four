# Spatial organization of AQP4 channels in the human brain: links with perfusion, edema, and disease vulnerability

This repository contains code (and lightweight derived data) used for the analyses in:

**Taheri T**, Farahani A, Liu Z-Q, Ceballos EG, Harroud A, Dagher A, Misic B.  
*Spatial organization of AQP4 channels in the human brain: links with perfusion, edema, and disease vulnerability.*  
bioRxiv (preprint): [ADD LINK AFTER POSTING]

## Overview
We map AQP4 gene expression across the human brain and relate this spatial organization to:
- vascular physiology (normative perfusion, vein density)
- neurodegenerative vulnerability (atrophy maps across diseases)
- neuroinflammation (normative PET markers)
- peritumoral edema

## Repository structure

### `scripts/`
Scripts to reproduce the main analyses and figures.
- `01_preprocess/` (loading + parcellation + QC)
- `02_analyses/` (correlations, distance-to-hotspot, sensitivity analyses)
- `03_figures/` (figure generation)

### `data/`
Small files needed to run the scripts (or links to where to download them).
Examples:
- parcellation files / region labels
- precomputed parcel-wise maps used in figures (if shareable)
- metadata tables

> Note: Some source datasets are publicly available but must be downloaded separately (e.g., AHBA, HCP, PET atlases).  
> See **Data availability** below.

### `results/`
Outputs generated by running the scripts (saved figures, tables, intermediate outputs).
(You can keep this folder out of the repo if it’s large; or include only summary tables.)

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.10 (or your version)
- Main packages: numpy, pandas, scipy, statsmodels, nilearn, nibabel, neuromaps, abagen, brainspace

Install example:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
